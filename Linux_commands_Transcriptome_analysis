#Commands for FASTQC and trim galore


#To make excutable forloop
nano filename for making it as loop and write command
control x to exit
choose yes to save it

# Make it excutable
 chmod 755 filename
755 runs all file types 
Should show file in green colour now

#To run the command

bash qc_trimm 

for fileNum in {1..12}
do
        file=/home/SequencingData/kumar/Resistance_Irinotecan/BC_${fileNum}.fastq.gz
        nohup trim_galore --fastqc $file > ${fileNum}.out & 
done

$ top -u username to see the progress

#After trimming and quality control we run alignment of our fastq files to reference sequence

done 

#After we sam file format from alignment we need to convert that file to Bam file format for counting step
samtools view -S -b /home/kumar/Resistance_Irinotecan/1.sam -o 1.bam
#Run all codes by changing the sample numbers to convert to BAM

#After alignment we use output file of alignment to count the number of the reads per sample

featureCounts -T 16 -a /home/Genomes/Human/hg38/ensembl/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.97.gtf -o featurecounts.txt /home/kumar/Resistance_Irinotecan/alignment_bam/1.bam

#Last code will give featureCount file that will be used further in R environment to calculate differential expression of genes using edgeR.
